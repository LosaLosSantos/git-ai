# Gitaly documentation

The historical reasons for the inception of Gitaly and our design decisions are
written in [the design doc](DESIGN.md).

## Configuring Gitaly

Running Gitaly requires it to be configured correctly, options are described in
the GitLab [Gitaly configuration documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/).

The reference guide is documented in <https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/reference/>.

## Developing Gitaly

- When new to Gitaly development, start by reading the [beginners guide](beginners_guide.md)
- To call a locally running Gitaly or Praefect, see
  [Invoking gRPC endpoints locally](invoking_grpc_endpoints_locally.md)
- The Gitaly release process is described in [our process doc](PROCESS.md)
- Praefect uses SQL. To create a new SQL migration see [SQL migrations in Praefect](sql_migrations.md)
- For Gitaly hooks documentation, see [Gitaly hooks documentation](hooks.md)
- To configure an environment for developing Gitaly on Kubernetes, see the
  [Gitaly on GKE Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/infra-standards/project-templates/gitaly-on-gke-template) repository.

## Gitaly Cluster

Gitaly does not replicate any data. If a Gitaly server goes down, any of its
clients can't read or write to the repositories stored on that server. This
means that Gitaly is not highly available. How this will be solved is described
[in the HA design document](design_ha.md).

For configuration please read [Praefect's configuration documentation](configuration/praefect.md).

## Upgrading the Go version used by Gitaly

To upgrade the version of Go that is used by Gitaly requires:

- Updating multiple files within the Gitaly repository.
- Ensuring compatible Go versions in all dependent repositories.

For more information, see [Upgrading Go used by Gitaly](go_upgrade_gitaly.md)
