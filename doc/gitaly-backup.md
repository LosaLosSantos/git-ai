# `gitaly-backup`

## Overview

The `gitaly-backup tool` establishes a gRPC connection with a Gitaly instance to facilitate repository backups by requesting
backup data and transferring it to a specified storage sink, either locally or in a remote cloud storage service (such as AWS S3,
Google Cloud Storage, or Azure).

Gitaly supports two backup approaches:

1. The `gitaly-backup` CLI initiates Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to the Gitaly server requesting backup data for one or more repositories.
   The Gitaly server generates the backup data and streams it back to `gitaly-backup` over the RPC connection. `gitaly-backup` then
   transfers the received data to the specified storage destination, as defined by the `-path` argument.

    > [!note]
    > In setups where Gitaly and `gitaly-backup` run on the same host (such as smaller reference architectures with fewer than 1,000 seats),
    > this approach can reduce network load on Gitaly by offloading remote network egress overhead to the `gitaly-backup` CLI. Since Gitaly streams backup data locally via gRPC,
    > it minimizes network congestion and improves efficiency.

1. Direct Gitaly Server-Side Backup – This approach prioritizes direct transfer from Gitaly server to the destination sink.
   CLI initiates Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to the Gitaly server requesting backup data for one or more repositories.
   The Gitaly server generates the backup data and streams this directly to the storage backend configured in the Gitaly configuration file.
   in the Gitaly [`config.toml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/config.toml.example)

## How to set up for backup

1. For each project to backup, find the Gitaly storage name and relative or disk path using either:
   - The [Admin area](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/repository_storage_paths/#from-project-name-to-hashed-path).
   - The [repository storage API](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/projects/#retrieve-the-path-to-repository-storage).
1. Generate the `GITALY_SERVERS` environment variable. This variable specifies
   the address and authentication details of each storage to restore to. The variable takes a base64-encoded JSON object.

   For example:

   ```shell
   export GITALY_SERVERS=`echo '{"default":{"address":"unix:/var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/gitaly.socket","token":""}}' | base64 --wrap=0`
   ```

1. Generate the backup job file. The job file consists of a series of JSON objects separated by a new line (`\n`).

   | Attribute           | Type     | Required | Description |
   |:--------------------|:---------|:---------|:------------|
   |  `address`          |  string  |  no      |  Address of the Gitaly or Gitaly Cluster server. Overrides the address specified in `GITALY_SERVERS`. |
   |  `token`            |  string  |  no      |  Authentication token for the Gitaly server. Overrides the token specified in `GITALY_SERVERS`. |
   |  `storage_name`     |  string  |  yes     |  Name of the storage where the repository is stored. |
   |  `relative_path`    |  string  |  yes     |  Relative path of the repository. |
   |  `gl_project_path`  |  string  |  no      |  Name of the project. Used for logging. |

   For example, `backup_job.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "storage_name":"default",
     "relative_path":"@hashed/f5/ca/f5ca38f748a1d6eaf726b8a42fb575c3c71f1864a8143301782de13da2d9202b.git",
     "gl_project_path":"diaspora/diaspora-client"
   }
   {
     "storage_name":"default",
     "relative_path":"@hashed/6b/86/6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b.git",
     "gl_project_path":"brightbox/puppet"
   }
   ```

## Gitaly-Backup Client-Orchestrated backup

1. Pipe the backup job file to `gitaly-backup create`.
   Set up the environment as show in [Set up environment step](#how-to-set-up-for-backup)

    ```shell
    /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly-backup create -path $BACKUP_DESTINATION_PATH < backup_job.json
    ```

    | Argument              | Type      | Required | Description |
    |:----------------------|:----------|:---------|:------------|
    |  `-path`              |  string   |  yes     |  Directory where the backup files will be created. |
    |  `-path-prefix`       |  string   |  no      |  Optional directory prefix where backups will be created, useful for time-based rotation of the backup destination. |
    |  `-parallel`          |  integer  |  no      |  Maximum number of parallel backups. |
    |  `-parallel-storage`  |  integer  |  no      |  Maximum number of parallel backups per storage. |
    |  `-id`                |  string   |  no      |  Used to determine a unique path for the backup when a full backup is created. |
    |  `-incremental`       |  bool     |  no      |  Indicates whether to create an incremental backup. |
    |  `-server-side`       |  bool     |  no      |  Indicates whether to use server-side backups. |

## Gitaly-Backup Client-Orchestrated Restore

Set up the environment as show in [Set up environment step](#how-to-set-up-for-backup)

1. Pipe the restore job file to `gitaly-backup restore`.

   ```shell
    /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly-backup restore -path $BACKUP_SOURCE_PATH < restore_job.json
   ```

     | Argument                    | Type                   | Required | Description |
    |:----------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------|:------------|
     |  `-path`                    |  string                |  yes     |  Directory where the backup files are stored. |
     |  `-path-prefix`             |  string                |  no      |  Optional directory prefix where backups will be created, useful for time-based rotation of the backup destination. |
     |  `-parallel`                |  integer               |  no      |  Maximum number of parallel restores. |
     |  `-parallel-storage`        |  integer               |  no      |  Maximum number of parallel restores per storage. |
     |  `-id`                      |  string                |  no      |  ID of full backup to restore. If not specified, the latest backup is restored (default). |
     |  `-remove-all-repositories` |  comma-separated list  |  no      |  List of storage names to have all repositories removed from before restoring. You must specify `GITALY_SERVERS` for the listed storage names. |
     |  `-server-side`             |  bool                  |  no      |  Indicates whether to use server-side backups. |

## Direct Gitaly Server-side backup

Server-side create stream backup data from the object storage sink defined in the Gitaly config.
To use server-side create:

1. Set up the environment and create backup job file as show in [Set up environment step](#how-to-set-up-for-backup).
1. Add backup parameters (`enabled` and `go_cloud_url`) to the Gitaly `config.toml` file.

   ```toml
   [backup]
   go_cloud_url = "s3://gitaly-backup?region=us-east-1"
   ```

    See [object storage](#object-storage) for information on how to configure `go_cloud_url` storage.

1. Ensure the Gitaly user or IAM credentials has access to the object storage i.e:
   - in aws ensure the role has a policy similar to :

     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "s3:PutObject",
             "s3:GetObject",
             "s3:ListBucket"
           ],
           "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:s3:::gitaly-backup",
             "arn:aws:s3:::gitaly-backup/*"
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

   - In gcp the Gitaly user/service account

     ````json
     {
       "bindings": [
         {
           "role": [
             "roles/storage.objectGet",
             "roles/storage.objectList",
             "roles/storage.objectPut"
           ],
           "members": [
             "serviceAccount:<your-service-account>@<your-project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ````

1. Restart your Gitaly server.
1. Pipe the backup job file to `gitaly-backup create`.

   ```shell
    /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly-backup create -server-side < backup_job.json
   ```

   | Argument                    | Type                   | Required | Description |
   |:----------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------|:------------|
   |  `-parallel`                |  integer               | no       |  Maximum number of parallel restores. |
   |  `-parallel-storage`        |  integer               | no       |  Maximum number of parallel restores per storage. |
   |  `-id`                      |  string                | no       |  ID of full backup to restore. If not specified, the latest backup is restored (default). |
   |  `-remove-all-repositories` |  comma-separated list  | no       |  List of storage names to have all repositories removed from before restoring. You must specify `GITALY_SERVERS` for the listed storage names. |
   |  `-server-side`             |  bool                  | yes      |  Indicates whether to use server-side backups. |
   |  `-path-prefix`             |  string                | no       |  Optional directory prefix where backups will be created, useful for time-based rotation of the backup destination. |

   Important: Do not set `-path` flag. It cannot be used in server-side mode as Gitaly uses the `go_cloud_url` set in the Gitaly config file.

### WORM (Write Once Read Many) server-side backups

Gitaly does not modify or delete any backup files that are already uploaded.
Therefore, it is compatible with WORM storages.

## Direct Gitaly Server-side restore

Server-side restore stream backup data from the object storage sink defined in the Gitaly config.
To use server-side restore:

1. Set up the environment and create backup job file as show in [Set up environment step](#how-to-set-up-for-backup)
1. Add backup parameters (`enabled` and `go_cloud_url`) to the Gitaly `config.toml` file.

   ```toml
   [backup]
   go_cloud_url = "s3://gitaly-backup?region=us-east-1"
   ```

   See [object storage](#object-storage) for information on how to configure `go_cloud_url` storage.

1. Ensure the Gitaly user or IAM credentials has access to the object storage i.e:

   - in aws ensure the role has a policy similar to :

     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "s3:PutObject",
             "s3:GetObject",
             "s3:ListBucket"
           ],
           "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:s3:::gitaly-backup",
             "arn:aws:s3:::gitaly-backup/*"
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

   - In gcp the Gitaly user/service account

     ````json
     {
       "bindings": [
         {
           "role": [
             "roles/storage.objectGet",
             "roles/storage.objectList",
             "roles/storage.objectPut"
           ],
           "members": [
             "serviceAccount:<your-service-account>@<your-project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ````

1. Restart your Gitaly server.
1. Pipe the backup job file to `gitaly-backup restore`.

   ```shell
    /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly-backup restore -server-side < backup_job.json
   ```

   | Argument                    | Type                   | Required | Description |
    |:----------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------|:------------|
   |  `-parallel`                |  integer               | no       |  Maximum number of parallel restores. |
   |  `-parallel-storage`        |  integer               | no       |  Maximum number of parallel restores per storage. |
   |  `-id`                      |  string                | no       |  ID of full backup to restore. If not specified, the latest backup is restored (default). |
   |  `-remove-all-repositories` |  comma-separated list  | no       |  List of storage names to have all repositories removed from before restoring. You must specify `GITALY_SERVERS` for the listed storage names. |
   |  `-server-side`             |  bool                  | yes      |  Indicates whether to use server-side backups. |
   |  `-path-prefix`             |  string                | no       |  Optional directory prefix where backups will be created, useful for time-based rotation of the backup destination. |

   Important: Do not set `-path` flag. It cannot be used in server-side mode as Gitaly uses the `go_cloud_url` set in the Gitaly config file.

## Concepts and Flags

### Path

Path determines where on the local filesystem or in object storage backup files
are created on or restored from. The path is set using the `-path` flag.

### Local Filesystem

If `-path` specifies a local filesystem, it is the root of where all backup
files are created.

### Object Storage

`gitaly-backup` supports streaming backup files directly to object storage
using the [`gocloud.dev/blob`](https://pkg.go.dev/gocloud.dev/blob) library.
`-path` or `go_cloud_url` can be used with:

- [Amazon S3](https://pkg.go.dev/gocloud.dev/blob/s3blob). For example `go_cloud_url = "s3://my-bucket?region=us-west-1"`.
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://pkg.go.dev/gocloud.dev/blob/azureblob). For example `go_cloud_url = "azblob://my-container"`.
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://pkg.go.dev/gocloud.dev/blob/gcsblob). For example `go_cloud_url = "gs//my-bucket"`.
- [memory block storage backend](https://pkg.go.dev/gocloud.dev/blob/memblob). For example `go_cloud_url = "mem://my-backup"`.
- [Filesystem storage backend](https://pkg.go.dev/gocloud.dev@v0.40.0/blob/fileblob) for example `go_cloud_url = "/tmp//my-backup"`.

Since not all s3-compatible storage backends support integrity checks, if `endpoint`
parameter is configured, Gitaly defaults to disabling these checks by using the query
parameter `request_checksum_calculation=when_required`.
To enable checksum calculation for any third-party s3 provider, which is required for
S3 Object Lock, include the `request_checksum_calculation=when_supported` query parameter
in the provided `go_cloud_url` within the Gitaly config.

### Reference backends

A backup records nothing about the reference backend of the repository it was taken from. The
bundle it contains works with any backend, so a restore that has to recreate the repository
creates it the way the Gitaly node creates any other new repository. The default changes between
releases, and a restore follows whatever the node uses at the time, so a repository does not
necessarily come back on the backend it was backed up from.

Pass `--reference-backend` to choose a backend instead of letting the node decide. It accepts
`files`, `reftable` and `mvcc`:

```shell
gitaly-backup restore --path $BACKUP_DESTINATION_PATH --reference-backend mvcc < repositories.json
```

The flag only applies to repositories that the restore has to create. A repository that still
exists keeps the backend it already uses. Restoring on the `mvcc` backend requires the target
Gitaly to ship the MVCC-enabled Git binary, as it is the only one that can read those
repositories.

## Backup Layout

The way backup files are arranged on the filesystem or on object storage is
determined by the manifest layout. Gitaly uses manifest files to describe
where each file exists in a backup to restore the files from the backup.
Every backup has one manifest named after the backup ID.

For example, the following structure is created for a repository with the:

- Storage name of `default`.
- Relative path of `@hashed/4e/c9/4ec9599fc203d176a301536c2e091a19bc852759b255bd6818810a42c5fed14a.git`.
- Backup ID of `20210930065413`.
- Backup path prefix of `feb-2026`

```plaintext
$BACKUP_DESTINATION_PATH/
  feb-2026/
    manifests/
      default/
        @hashed/
          4e/
            c9/
              4ec9599fc203d176a301536c2e091a19bc852759b255bd6818810a42c5fed14a.git/
                20210930065413.toml
    default/
      @hashed/
        4e/
          c9/
            4ec9599fc203d176a301536c2e091a19bc852759b255bd6818810a42c5fed14a.git/
              20210930065413/
                001.bundle
                001.refs
```

If an incremental backup was then created with a backup ID of `20211001065419`,
`gitaly-backup` would create the following structure:

```plaintext
