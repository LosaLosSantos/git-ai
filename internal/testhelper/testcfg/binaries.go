		// When the user's system has multiple Go toolchains managed by a version manager like

		// these tools. The tools rely on executing a hook command (i.e. `mise activate`) in
		// the user's shell profile to reconfigure environment variables to dynamically change
		// the Go version. Mise for instance will overwrite PATH and various GO* variables.
		//
		// If the IDE doesn't also execute this hook command, it will be reliant on using the
		// environment variables inherited from the shell which started it, which will likely
		// point to a global version of Go, not the one defined in .tool-versions.
		//
		// We can check the error and provide some guidance to the user on reconfiguring the
		// global Go version to match. This is preferable from manipulating the environment
		// variables as we would then be compiling binaries with a random version of Go.
		//
		// For example, if mise was configured globally to use Go 1.24.2 globally via
		// `mise use -g go@1.24.2` but the .tool-versions file declares 1.23.6, the following
