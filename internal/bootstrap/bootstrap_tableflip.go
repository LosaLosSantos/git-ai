// creation responsibility must be delegated to the `tableflip` library so
// it can transfer socket's file descriptors to the new process it will spawn
// during the graceful upgrade process.
//
// When the current process starts, it must call Ready().
// When the current process stops, it must call Upgrade(), which will trigger
// a new Gitaly process creation. Once this new process is ready, as stated
// above, it will call Ready(). Calling Ready() unblocks the Exit channel on the
// parent process, which informs it that it can now safely exit.
