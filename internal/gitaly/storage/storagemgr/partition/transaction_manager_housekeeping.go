// removed. The reflogs are also removed. In addition, we don't use reflogs in Gitaly as core.logAllRefUpdates defaults
// to false in bare repositories. It could of course be that an admin manually enabled it by modifying the config
// on-disk directly. There is no way to extract reference deletion between two states.
