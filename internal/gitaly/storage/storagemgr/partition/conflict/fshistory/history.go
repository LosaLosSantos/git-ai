// History keeps track of file system operations performed by transactions

//
// The operations are kept in the History until the LSN is explicitly evicted.
// TransactionManager evicts an LSN once there are no more transactions reading
// at older snapshots. Newer transaction would already see the changes in their
// snapshots and base their changes on them.
//
// The operations are recorded in tree structure that represents all of the
// file system operations performed. Correct file system structure is enforced.
// In addition to live directory and file nodes, the tree holds negative nodes
// to track directory entry removals. Negative nodes can be present under all
// other node types, including other negative nodes and file nodes. While a
// directory tree typically wouldn't allow for nodes below these nodes, this
// enables checking against conflicts even if the tree structure would have
// otherwise required to remove these nodes.
//
// On top of enforcing a valid directory hierarchy, the History produces
// conflicts if a node was concurrently updated after a transaction read it.
// This is done by recording the LSN of the last transaction that modified a node.
// If the nodes LSN is greater than the LSN the transaction was reading at, it hasn't
// seen the changes and conflicts. Transactions are assumed to be correct in isolation
// and that they only perform operations that were valid in their own snapshot. Only
// conflicts introduced by concurrent transactions are detected.
